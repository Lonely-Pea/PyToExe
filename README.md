## Introduction

PyToExe is software based on Python.<br>
It can help you package python files into executable programs.<br>
And it provides a interface that you can just click to package python files.<br>
It calls pyinstaller and nuitka to help packaging your files.<br>
Now the lauguage of the software is Chinese 'cause the maker is from China.(So this file may have a lot of grammar mistakes.)<br>
Now you still cannot change the display lauguage 'cuase I'v not set a lauguage file.<br>
Just Wait.<br>

## Principle

The interface of the software is based on Python module tkinter.<br>
To package python files into executable programs, it calls pyinstaller or nuitka.<br>

## Code Explanation

### Modules Needed

Here is all the modules this program need and their purposes:<br>

| modules            | purposes             |
| :----------------- | :------------------- |
| tkinter            | interface based      |
| tkinter.messagebox | message popup        |
| tkinter.ttk        | interface based      |
| os                 | system orders called |
| time               | animation needed     |
| threading          | more threads builded |
| random             | random number made   |

### self_builede Modules

Here is all the self-builded modules and their purposes:<br>

| modules  | purposes          |
| :------- | :---------------- |
| constant | constant saved    |
| option   | interface builded |
| function | packaging         |

### How To Run the Program

To run this program,you need to run file main.py

### File main.py

In file main.py,we use these codes to build the interface and functions:<br>

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  window = Window()  # build root window
  desktop = Desktop(master=window)  # build interface

  window.mainloop()  # display the root window
```

Variable _window_ is the earth for all the things work on.

### File constant.py

In file constant.py,I write some variables into it.<br>
Like this:<br>

```python
INSTALL_TEXT = [
  "pip install pyinstaller",
  "pip install nuitka"
]
```

These strings are to install pyinstaller and nuitka for packaging.<br>

### File function.py

In file function.py,we build a function:<br>

> make_file(file_from_path, file_output_path="", file_icon_path="", tool="pyinstaller", module="Basic", if_python=False, one_file=(False, True),
> if_cmd=(False, False))

to build executable programs.<br>
We just convert parameters into codes and rutuen final result _test_<br>
Like this:<br>

```python
text = ""
if tool == COMBOBOX_TEXT[1][1]:  # pyinstaller called
  text += COMBOBOX_TEXT[1][1]  # write "pyinstaller" at the front
  if one_file[1]:  # one_file setted
    text += " %s" % PYINSTALLER_TEXTS[1]  # write "-w" behind "pyinstaller"
```

### File option.py

In file option.py,we build the interface of the program.The place with the most codes is just here.<br>

Here is all the class and their purposes in the file:<br>

| class                      | purposes               |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Window(tk.Tk)              | root window builded    |
| Desktop(tk.Frame)          | main interface builded |
| ToplevelAbout(tk.Toplevel) | build About window     |
| ToplevelInfo(tk.Toplevel)  | build help window      |

#### Window(tk.Tk)

In this class, there is a function called set(self) that can set the root window.

Here are the explanations of the codes:<br>

```python
self.screenwidth = self.winfo_screenwidth()
self.screenheight = self.winfo_screenheight()
self.x = (self.screenwidth - WINDOW_WIDTH) / 2
self.y = (self.screenheight - WINDOW_HEIGHT) / 2
self.size = "%dx%d+%d+%d" % (WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, self.x, self.y)
```

Get the width and the height of the screen:

> self.screenwidth = self.winfo_screenwidth()
>
> self.screenheight = self.winfo_screenheight()

Get the x coordinate and y coordinate:

> self.x = (self.screenwidth - WINDOW_WIDTH) / 2
>
> self.y = (self.screenheight - WINDOW_HEIGHT) / 2

#### Desktop(tk.Frame)

In this class, also the-most-code-written place, we build the main interface.<br>

Here is all the functions that are called in \_\_init\_\_(self, master) ,the functions these functions called in this class, the variable globalized in there functions and the variable there functions needed:<br>

| function                       | function called                                                                             | variable globalized | variable needed                                                                 |

There are a bit too much.It doesn't matter.Just let me introduce some of them.

##### info()

I think you know how to make interface by tkinter, so I won't introduce the functions of building tkinter interface.(The true reason is that I'm a bit lazy.)<br>

Now I only introduce the Function info().Look at the codes first:<br>

> thread_change = Thread(target=self.change_info_label, args=())
>
> thread_change.start()

These codes are to build a now thread to make the main program not getting caton.

We know this function called a new function called self.change_info_label().<br>
Then let we just check out this function.<br>

###### self.change_info_label()

```python
n = 0
while True:
  n_ = random.randint(0, len(INFO_LABEL_TEXTS)-1)
  if n_ == n:
    continue
  else:
    n = n_
    self.entry_var.set(INFO_LABEL_TEXTS[n])
    self.master.update()
    time.sleep(10)
```

Look at the codes above.<br>
We first make a temporary variable called _n_.<br>
Then, we build a _while_ circulate.<br>
In this circulate, we first make a random number as the index of the list.<br>
If the random number \_n\__ is as same as \_n_, we just "while" again.<br>
Then we use the index to choose the element in the list and take it as the element of the variable self.entry_var.<br>
Then, we use the module time and its function sleep() to pause the thread for 10 seconds.<br>
Then, the next "while" again.<br>
It is not difficult if you now a little of python grammar.<br>

#### ToplevelAbout(tk.Toplevel) and ToplevelInfo(tk.Toplevel)

As you know, they are seem to be same.So I just choose one of them for the introduction.<br>

Building window is like the steps in class Window(tk.Tk)<br>
building label to show the about information is a bit easy.

Something we need to know is that we can change the value of the element justify in the class tk.Label().<br>
Like this:<br>

> text = tk.Label(self, text=ABOUT_TEXT, justify="left")
>
> text.place(x=0, y=0, width=TOPLEVEL_WIDTH \* 3)

Here are the differences of _justify_ and _anchor_:<br>

| element | value                                              | purpose      |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| justify | left<br>right<br>center<br>                        | For lines    |
| anchor  | e<br>w<br>n<br>s<br>ne<br>se<br>nw<br>sw<br>center | for one line |

Here are the means of the possible values of the element _anchor_:<br>
|value|mean|
|:---|:---|
|e|East|
|w|West|
|n|north|
|s|south|
|ne|northeast|
|se|southeast|
|nw|northwest|
|sw|southwest|
|center|center|
